    <h1>About ME</Menu></h1>
    <p>My favorite childhood memory was when I was when i was in 3rd grade. I had met someone on the playground and his name was issac. We were playing after school and we came up with a bad song about friendship (lol). We became best friends and I ended up going to his house and playing with him. I also remember he had a wagon that we'd go down the street in super fast becasue his street was a downward slope (lol).</p>
    <p> my current faviorite movie is A Silent_Voice becasue i cant think of any others.</p>
